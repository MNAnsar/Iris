# Iris
Iris flower has three species; setosa, versicolor, and virginica, which differs according to their
measurements. 
In our recent project, we delved into the realm of machine learning by working with the measurements 
of iris flowers across different species. The primary objective was to develop and train a sophisticated 
machine learning model capable of discerning patterns and nuances within the iris species based on their 
specific measurements. This involved meticulous data analysis and the utilization of advanced algorithms to 
enable accurate classification. Our goal was to harness the power of machine learning to create a robust model 
that can not only comprehend the inherent differences in iris species but also make precise classifications based 
on these intricate measurements. This project represents a significant step forward in our exploration of 
machine learning applications, demonstrating our commitment to staying at the forefront of cutting-edge technologies.
